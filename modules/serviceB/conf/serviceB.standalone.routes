# Note that you do not need to prefix routes or controller packages with the service name.
# Doing so, however, can make code management much easier.

->    /                  common.Routes

# This is the normal way of doing things:
#->    /serviceB          serviceB.Routes
#GET   /serviceB          controllers.serviceB.ServiceBController.main()
#GET   /serviceB/lottery  controllers.serviceB.ServiceBController.lottery()

# Does this work?
->    /serviceB          serviceB.Routes
